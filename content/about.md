Hi! I'm David, a computer science researcher with a passion for machine learning, programming, and mathematics. 
I use this blog to share my learning journey, implement ML projects, and post solutions to interesting algorithm challenges.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD in computer science at the University of Ljubljana.
For the last four years, I've also been a TA for postgraduate probability and statistics courses.
I do a lot of research on normalizing flows, a special family of generative models.
I use flows to speed up MCMC by transforming difficult data spaces into simple ones.
I've worked with fantastic people at the University of Ljubljana and UC Berkeley.
I've delivered talks for the Flatiron institute and the American Slovenian Education Foundation.
I'm also very proud and privileged to have won an award at the 2021 NASA/ESA/JAXA Earth Observation Dashboard competition with five amazing teammates.

Feel free to check out some of my recent papers:
* [Empirical evaluation of normalizing flows in Markov chain Monte Carlo (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-025-06900-3)
* [Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning (2025)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.02345)
* [Control, Transport and Sampling: Towards Better Loss Design (2024)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.13731)
* [Accelerating astronomical and cosmological inference with preconditioned Monte Carlo (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2272)
