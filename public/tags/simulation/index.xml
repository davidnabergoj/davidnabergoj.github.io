      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in a series solving problems from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Challenging-Problems-Probability-Solutions-Mathematics/dp/0486653552&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability&lt;/em&gt; by Frederick Mosteller (1987)&lt;/a&gt;.
The problem is paraphrased below; for reference, it is inspired by the original book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawer contains some red and black socks. Two socks are drawn at random, and the probability that both are red is  \(1/2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the minimum total number of socks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the minimum if the number of black socks is even?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ellis is a tennis player who has to compete against two players: his father and the tennis club champion. The champion is a better player than the father. Ellis will play a three-set series with alternating opponents. He can either play his father first, then the champion, then his father again; or the champion first, then his father, then the champion again. If he wins two sets in a row, he wins a special prize.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
